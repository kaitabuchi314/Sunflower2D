# Sunflower 2D
Sunflower 2D is a 2D SDL-based game engine. This game engine is meant to learn C++, to make an indie game, or even for pro teams to use.

# How to setup
First, install python. Next, clone the repo using `git clone --recursive https://github.com/kaitabuchi314/Sunflower2D.git`. Then go into Scripts and click on Windows-Gen-Projects if you are on windows. Otherwise, go into a terminal and do `premake5 ` and then your editor.
Example:
Mac: `premake5 xcode4`
Mac or Linux: `premake5 codelite`
Linux: `premake5 gmake2`
For Mac, it makes an XCode project, for linux, it makes a Codelite project, and for Windows, a vs2022 project. Note: On Windows or Mac, you can run the Linux script if you use codelite. Then, go into the terminal inside the repo's folder, and run `python SetProject.py` and type "App", then press enter.
